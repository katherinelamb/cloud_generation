Generative modeling for data augmentation of cloud satellite image dataset

## Motivation
Inspired by a cloud classification Kaggle problem (https://www.kaggle.com/c/understanding_cloud_organization/overview)
Many of the classifiers used in the competition use data augmentation techniques to improve results. 
We would like to use a GAN to generate data samples for data augmentation.
